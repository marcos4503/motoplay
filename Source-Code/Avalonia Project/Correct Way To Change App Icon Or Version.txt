To make property changes to an Avalonia Project, it is useful to make the same changes to
both Solutions contained in the project. So, for example, when changing the Icon or Version
of the application, it is useful to make the same changes to the "AppName" and "AppName.Desktop"
solutions. To make the changes, simply right-click on a solution, and then click on "Properties".
