To Compile and Run a Avalonia App on Raspberry Pi x64...

1. Setup the "Publish" of the App to run in Raspberry Pi.
   - Right-click on the App project to be compiled (AppName.Desktop).
   - Click "Publish..."
   - If no Publishing Profile has been created, a wizard window will open.
	 - On the "Destination" tab, select "Folder" and click "Next".
	 - On the "Specific Destination" tab, select "Folder" and click "Next".
	 - In the "Location" tab, select a desired Folder Location where you would like the resulting Compilation
	   files to be placed. Once done, click "Finish".
	 - Close the Wizard Window.
   - Now, in the Publishing Area, click on "Show All Settings"
   - Under "Setup" choose "Release | Any CPU"
   - Under "Target Framework" choose the version of .NET Core to use.
   - Under "Deployment Mode" choose "Self-Contained".
   - Under "Destiny Runtime" choose "linux-arm64".
   - Click "Save"

2. Now, whenever you want to Compile the App, Right Click on the "AppName.Desktop" project, then 
   click "Publish...". In the window that opens, click "Publish" again. The files resulting from the compilation
   of the Application will be placed in the path specified in "Destination Location".

3. Take all the files resulting from the Compilation, and copy them to any location on the Raspberry Pi, as
   you prefer.

4. On the Raspberry Pi, open the Terminal and use the command below to make the "AppName.Desktop" file present in
   the files resulting from the Compilation executable.
   - sudo chmod +x "CopiedFilesPath/AppName.Desktop"

5. Finally, to run your Avalonia Application on Raspberry Pi, use the command below.
   - sudo "CopiedFilesPath/AppName.Desktop"
