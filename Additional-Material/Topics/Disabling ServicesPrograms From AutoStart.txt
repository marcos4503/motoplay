                          DISABLING SERVICES/PROGRAMS FROM AUTOSTART
################################################################################################

Disabling Services/Programs that run automatically after system startup can help reduce system
startup time and resource usage. First, you need to know which processes are running on your
system. To do this, use the command below...
    - systemctl --type=service

Now, to disable a Service, just use the command below...
    - sudo systemctl disable <service name>
      - EXAMPLE: sudo systemctl disable sshd.service

The list below contains some common processes that can be disabled, but of course, make sure that
you really won't use them if you do turn them off.
    - avahi-daemon.service
      - It allows devices and applications to find and communicate with each other on a local network
        without the need for manual configuration of DNS servers.
    - cups-browsed.service
      - Is a daemon that facilitates the discovery and integration of remote printers into the
        local network.
    - cups.service
      - Is part of the Common UNIX Printing System ,CUPS, which is a modular printing system used to
        manage printers and print jobs.
    - ModemManager.service
      - Is a DBus-enabled daemon that manages mobile broadband interfaces such as 2G, 3G, 4G and 
        5G. It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with modems, making it easier to configure
        and connect mobile modems.
