                      CHANGING HEIGHT AND RASPBERRY ICON OF TASKBAR
################################################################################################

This guide will teach you how to change the Raspberry icon on your Raspberry Pi Taskbar 
(or Menu/Launcher) to any other image you want.

Note that all steps listed here MUST ONLY be done after your system has completed at least the 
first initialization. So if you've just installed a new system on your Raspberry Pi's SD Card, 
turn it on and let the system do its first boot. When finished, restart it and then you can 
perform the steps listed here!

Finally, keep in mind that the content shown here was tested on Raspbian OS version Bookworm!

Starting...





--> Step 1

First, let's start by defining a size for our Taskbar. To do this, right-click on an empty space 
on the Raspberry Pi's Taskbar. Now, click on "Taskbar Preferences...".

--> Step 2

In the window that opens, on the "Taskbar" tab... Click on the "Size" dropbox, and then just 
choose a size. You can also define whether the Taskbar should appear at the Bottom or Top of the
screen, through the "Position" option. When finished, just click "OK".

This change in the size of the Taskbar can help you have more space on the Screen, depending on
your Resolution.

--> Step 3

Now, we will change the Taskbar Menu image, replacing the default Raspberry image. Build an image
that you want to be the taskbar menu image, and name it as "icon.png". The resolution of this 
image must be according to the Size you set for your Taskbar...
    - Very Large: 48x48
    - Large:      32x32
    - Medium:     24x24
    - Small:      16x16
After finishing developing the image, place it in the Root of a Pendrive.

--> Step 4

Put the Pendrive on Raspberry. Use the commands below to install the new splash image on your system...
    - sudo cp "/media/<username>/<drive name>/icon.png" "/home/icon.png"
      - EXAMPLE: sudo cp "/media/marcos/MY DRIVE/icon.png" "/home/icon.png"
    - Run the next command according to the Size you set for your Taskbar...
      - Very Large:  sudo rm "/usr/share/icons/PiXflat/48x48/places/start-here.png"
      - Large:       sudo rm "/usr/share/icons/PiXflat/32x32/places/start-here.png"
      - Medium:      sudo rm "/usr/share/icons/PiXflat/24x24/places/start-here.png"
      - Small:       sudo rm "/usr/share/icons/PiXflat/16x16/places/start-here.png"
    - Run the next command according to the Size you set for your Taskbar...
      - Very Large:  sudo cp "/home/icon.png" "/usr/share/icons/PiXflat/48x48/places/start-here.png"
      - Large:       sudo cp "/home/icon.png" "/usr/share/icons/PiXflat/32x32/places/start-here.png"
      - Medium:      sudo cp "/home/icon.png" "/usr/share/icons/PiXflat/24x24/places/start-here.png"
      - Small:       sudo cp "/home/icon.png" "/usr/share/icons/PiXflat/16x16/places/start-here.png"
    - sudo plymouth-set-default-theme --rebuild-initrd pix
    - sudo reboot

--> Step 5

If you've done everything right so far, your Raspberry Pi should have restarted and you should see
the new taskbar menu icon!
