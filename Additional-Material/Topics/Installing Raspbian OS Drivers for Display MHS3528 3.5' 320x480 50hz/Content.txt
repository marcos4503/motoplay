               INSTALLING DRIVERS FOR DISPLAY MHS3528 TFT 3.5' 320x480 50HZ
################################################################################################

Display MHS3528 needs drivers installed to work, because it uses the GPIO to connect to the
Raspberry Pi. This guide will show you how to install the necessary drivers to make Display 
MHS3528 work on your Raspberry Pi.

Note that this Display only supports "Bullseye" versions of Raspbian OS, so please make sure your
Raspberry Pi is running a "Bullseye" version in a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

Starting...





--> Step 1

Connect your Display to the GPIO connectors on your Raspberry Pi. Use the images available in this
folder as an example.

If you are going to use a case with a fan or heat conductor, remember to buy and install Thermal
Pads to place between the chips and the heat conductor of the case, as in the images in this folder.

--> Step 2

First, connect to your Raspberry Pi's terminal, either via a normal USB keyboard or via SSH.

--> Step 3

Run the commands below on your Raspberry Pi...
    - sudo rm -rf LCD-show
    - git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git
    - chmod -R 755 LCD-show
    - cd LCD-show/
    - sudo ./MHS35-show

After that, the system should restart and after returning you should see an image on your Display.

NOTE: Alternatively, a copy of the "LCD-show.git" repository is available in the "Content to Download"
      folder, under "For Display MHS3528 3.5' 320x480 50hz", along with a copy of the Wiki of 
      this Display.

--> Step 4

If the Raspberry Pi has already restarted and the Display is showing image, now just check if the
Touch Screen is working. If so, simply run the commands below to make sure your system is up to
date...
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt upgrade
    - sudo apt full-upgrade
    - sudo apt autoremove

If you need to rotate the screen, use the command below...
    - cd LCD-show/
    - sudo ./rotate.sh 90
After executing this command, the system will restart and when it returns, the screen will be 
rotated. You can also use the values 0, 90, 180 and 270 to rotate.

--> Step 5

If everything went well so far, then now just enjoy your device!

--> Downloading Ready-to-Use Image

If you want to download a ready-to-use image that already has the Display MHS3528 driver installed,
go to the "Content to Download" folder in "For Display MHS3528 3.5' 320x480 50hz" and download the
image. After downloading it, just use "Win32DiskImager" to write it to an SD Card and then place it
on your Raspberry Pi. This image is pristine, with the Raspberry Pi Bullseye and Display MHS3528
Drivers newly installed.

Once the image is installed on your SD Card, simply install the Display on the Raspberry Pi, turn
it on and test it.

This ready-to-use image has the following credentials for the user and for SSH.
User:     rpi
Password: 1234

Finally, remember to update this image using the commands below...
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt upgrade
    - sudo apt full-upgrade
    - sudo apt autoremove

NOTE: This ready-to-use image was extracted from a 32GB SanDisk Ultra SD Card. Furthermore, this 
      image is nothing more than a newly obtained Raspbian OS Bullseye x64, and nothing has been 
      removed or added other than the driver for this Display. So if you need to make any 
      configurations or adjustments (like changing the paging file, or network adjustments for 
      example), you will need to do this after writing this image to your SD Card and running it 
      on your Raspberry Pi.
