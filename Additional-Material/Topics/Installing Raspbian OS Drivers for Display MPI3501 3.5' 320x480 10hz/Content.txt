               INSTALLING DRIVERS FOR DISPLAY MPI3501 TFT 3.5' 320x480 10HZ
################################################################################################

Display MPI3501 needs drivers installed to work. This guide will show you how to install the 
necessary drivers to make Display MPI3501 work on your Raspberry Pi.

Note that this Display only supports "Bullseye" versions of Raspbian OS, so please make sure your
Raspberry Pi is running a "Bullseye" version in a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

Starting...





--> Step 1

Connect your Display to the GPIO connectors on your Raspberry Pi. Use the images available in this
folder as an example.

If you are going to use a case with a fan or heat conductor, remember to buy Thermal Pads to place 
between the chips and the heat conductor of the case, as in the images in this folder.

--> Step 2

First, connect to your Raspberry Pi's terminal, either via a normal USB keyboard or via SSH.

--> Step 3

Run the commands below on your Raspberry Pi...
    - sudo rm -rf LCD-show
    - git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git
    - chmod -R 755 LCD-show
    - cd LCD-show/
    - sudo ./LCD35-show

After that, the system should restart and after returning you should see an image on your Display.

NOTE: Alternatively, a copy of the "LCD-show.git" repository is available in the "Download Content"
      folder, under "For Display MPI3501 3.5' 320x480 10hz", along with a copy of the Wiki of 
      this Display.

--> Step 4

If the Raspberry Pi has already restarted and the Display is showing image, now just check if the
Touch Screen is working. If so, simply run the commands below to make sure your system is up to
date...
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt upgrade
    - sudo apt full-upgrade
    - sudo apt autoremove

If you need to rotate the screen, use the command below...
    - cd LCD-show/
    - sudo ./rotate.sh 90
After executing this command, the system will restart and when it returns, the screen will be 
rotated. You can also use the values 0, 90, 180 and 270 to rotate.

--> Step 5

If everything went well so far, then now just enjoy your device!

--> Performing Touch Screen Calibration

This LCD can be calibrated using a program called "xinput_calibrator". To install it, run the
commands...
    - cd LCD-show/
    - sudo dpkg -i -B xinput-calibrator_0.7.5-1_armhf.deb
Now, click the "Raspberry" button on the task bar, choose "Preference" > "Calibrate Touchscreen".

Finish the touch calibration following the prompts. Maybe rebooting is required to make calibration
active.

You can create a 99-calibration.conf file to save the touch parameters (not necessary if
file exists).
    - /ect/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf



--> Downloading Ready-to-Use Image

If you want to download a ready-to-use image that already has the Display MPI3501 driver installed,
go to the "Content do Download" folder in "For Display MPI3501 3.5' 320x480 10hz" and download the
image. After downloading it, just use "Win32DiskImager" to write it to an SD Card and then place it
on your Raspberry Pi. This image is pristine, with the Raspberry Pi Bullseye and Display MPI3501
Drivers newly installed.

Once the image is installed on your SD Card, simply install the Display on the Raspberry Pi, turn
it on and test it.
