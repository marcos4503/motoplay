          CHANGING IMAGE OF WELCOME TO THE RASPBERRY PI DESKTOP SCREEN
################################################################################################

This guide will teach you how to change the Raspbian OS system welcome image, which appears during
system loading.

Note that all steps listed here MUST ONLY be done after your system has completed at least the 
first initialization. So if you've just installed a new system on your Raspberry Pi's SD Card, 
turn it on and let the system do its first boot. When finished, restart it and then you can 
perform the steps listed here!

Finally, keep in mind that the content shown here was tested on Raspbian OS version Bullseye and
Bookworm!

Starting...





--> Step 1

Build an image that you want to be the system loading image, and name it as "splash.png". It should
have a size of 1024x768. Then, place it in the root of a Pendrive.

--> Step 2

If this is your first time changing your system's splash image, then use the command below to make a
backup of the original image...
    - sudo cp "/usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/splash.png" "/home/splash-backup.png"
Use the commands below to install the new splash image on your system...
    - sudo rm "/home/splash.png"
    - sudo cp "/media/<username>/<drive name>/splash.png" "/home/splash.png"
      - EXAMPLE: sudo cp "/media/marcos/MY DRIVE/splash.png" "/home/splash.png"
    - sudo rm "/usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/splash.png"
    - sudo cp "/home/splash.png" "/usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/splash.png"
    - sudo plymouth-set-default-theme --rebuild-initrd pix
    - sudo reboot

--> Step 3

If you've done everything right so far, your Raspberry Pi should have restarted and you should see
the new boot image!
