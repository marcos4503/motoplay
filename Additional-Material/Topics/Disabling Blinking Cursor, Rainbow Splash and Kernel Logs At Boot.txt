          DISABLING BLINKING CURSOR, RAINBOW SPLASH AND NORMAL KERNEL LOGS AT BOOT
################################################################################################

This guide will teach you how to disable all of these Boot elements, basically leaving just a black
screen during the Boot process. This guide does not teach you how to change the "Welcome to the
Raspberry Pi Desktop" splash screen that appears during system loading.

Note that all steps listed here MUST ONLY be done after your system has completed at least the 
first initialization. So if you've just installed a new system on your Raspberry Pi's SD Card, 
turn it on and let the system do its first boot. When finished, restart it and then you can 
perform the steps listed here!

Finally, keep in mind that the content shown here was tested on Raspbian OS version Bullseye and
Bookworm!

Starting...





--> Step 1

On your Raspberry Pi, open the terminal and use the command below to open the system's "config.txt"
file...
    - sudo nano "/boot/firmware/config.txt"
After that, change the value of "disable_splash" to "1", as below...
    - disable_splash=1
If line "disable_splash=1" does not exist, add it to the end of file "config.txt". Now, just save the
file and close it.

--> Step 2

Still in the terminal, use the command below to open the "cmdline.txt" file...
    - sudo nano "/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt"
When opening this file, you will see that all the content is present in just one line, as in the
example below...
    - console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=7a905b6b-02 rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles
Add each parameter below, in the same order, to the end of this line of file "cmdline.txt"...
    - loglevel=3
    - vt.global_cursor_default=0
    - logo.nologo
The file "cmdline.txt" should look like the example below...
    - console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=7a905b6b-02 rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles loglevel=3 vt.global_cursor_default=0 logo.nologo
Now, just save the file and close it.

--> Step 3

Now, restart the device and after it turns back on, you should notice the changes.
