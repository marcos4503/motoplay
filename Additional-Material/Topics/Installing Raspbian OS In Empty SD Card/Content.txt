                        INSTALLING RASPBIAN OS IN A EMPTY SD CARD
################################################################################################

To install a copy of the Raspbian operating system on a blank SD Card, see the steps below. Keep
in mind that Raspbian OS is the official operating system for Raspberry PI devices, and is based
on the Debian OS system but optimized for Raspberry Pi devices.

It is worth remembering that Raspbibian OS has an LXDE user interface (desktop environment) on 
Bullseye versions or older, and Wayland on Bookworm+, optimized for Raspberry Pi devices, while 
Raspbian OS Lite does not have any graphical interface installed.

Note that all of these steps were created with a Windows system on the desktop computer in mind.

Starting...





--> Step 1

Place the SD Card you intend to use on your Raspberry Pi into your computer. You can use a USB, 
SD adapter or something similar.

--> Step 2

Open "Raspberry PI Imager". You can get a portable version of this program here at 
"Additional-Material" folder, in "Content to Download".

--> Step 3

Click on "CHOOSE DEVICE" to choose the device you intend to run the system on.

--> Step 4

Click "CHOOSE OS" to choose a desired version of Raspbian OS. I recommend you choose the latest
version and if your Raspberry Pi is 4 or newer, choose the x64 version.

Some Hardware (like some GPIO Displays) may be incompatible with new versions of 
Raspbian OS. Check whether the accessories you intend to use have any OS version limitations, 
if so, choose an OS version that your accessories support.

--> Step 5

Click on "CHOOSE STORAGE" and select your inserted SD Card, which you intend to use on the
Raspberry Pi. Now click "NEXT".

--> Step 6

In the dialog box that appears, click "EDIT SETTINGS".
    - In the "GENERAL" tab...
        - Check "Set Username And Password"
            - In "Username", enter "rpi" or something you prefer.
            - In "Password", enter the password that you want to use for your Raspberry Pi user
              and for the device SSH connections.
        - Check "Configure Wireless LAN"
            - In "SSID", enter the exact name of your home's WiFi network. The name of the network
              you want your Raspberry Pi to connect to.
            - In "Password", enter the exact password for this WiFi network.
            - In "Wireless LAN Country" select your country code.
        - Check "Set Locale Settings"
            - In "Time Zone" select your time zone.
            - In "Keyboard Layout" select the keyboard layout you intend to use.
    - In the "SERVICES" tab...
        - Check "Enable SSH"
            - Check "Use Password Authentication"

Finally, click "SAVE". Still in the dialog, click "YES". If your SD Card already contains information,
a warning will appear telling you that all content will be erased. Just confirm. 

--> Step 7

Now just wait until the process is complete.

--> Step 8

Once the process finishes, a warning box will appear saying that you can now remove the SD Card. Eject
it from the computer, and place the SD Card in your Raspberry Pi. Finally, turn on the Raspberry Pi.

--> Step 9

Wait a few moments to make sure the Raspberry Pi has booted up. Now, access your router's settings
panel and check if the Raspberry Pi has already connected to your home router, through the configured
WiFi network. If the Raspberry Pi appeared on the router, copy its IP in the local network.

If the Raspberry Pi does not appear connected to your router, try reloading the page, but if it persists
without appearing, this could mean that you have configured your Raspberry Pi's WiFi incorrectly.

--> Step 10

Using an SSH program like Putty, connect to your Raspberry Pi using the copied IP from router, and your
username and password configured in step 6. The connection can be made using the SSH version 2 protocol,
on port 22. 

--> Step 11

Now, already connected, just use the commands below to make sure the system is up to date.
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt upgrade
    - sudo apt full-upgrade
    - sudo apt autoremove

--> Step 12

If everything has gone well so far, just connect a monitor to your Raspberry Pi, a keyboard/mouse and
continue as you wish!
