# What is Motoplay?

Motoplay is a project that aims to bring an on-board computer to motorcycles. The main point is that this computer must be 100% functional, running Linux, for greater flexibility, and be able to interact with the vehicle's ECU to read information, have a media player, and several other functions. Basically, this computer should work as a kind of "second panel", with Touchscreen support, on the motorcycle's handlebars, so that the rider can count on several functions within reach of just a few touches.
