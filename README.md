# What is Motoplay?

Motoplay is a project that aims to bring an on-board computer to motorcycles. The main point is that this computer must be 100% functional, running Linux, for greater flexibility, and be able to interact with the vehicle's ECU to read information of motor and vehicle, have a media player and several other functions. Basically, this computer should work as a kind of "second panel", with Touchscreen input support, on the motorcycle's handlebars, so that the rider can count on several functions within reach of just a few touches.

The project is divided into two layers, the Hardware layer and the Software layer. The Hardware layer consists of all the accessories (peripherals) that will be installed on the motorcycle and that will be used by the on-board computer, such as speakers, 5v3a USB output, camera, etc.

In the second layer, in Software, we will have the Linux operating system, which will run the "Motoplay" software in full time, which is a program that will function as the on-board computer's central hub, being the key point for the pilot's use of the computer.

Of course, there are some mandatory Hardware accessories that need to be installed on your motorcycle if you intend to use Motoplay. All of these components are listed below. After that, there are some necessary procedures to prepare the computer and install the "Motoplay" program on the computer. All of this and many other details are all documented on this page, if you want to continue learning more, just keep reading!

# What Hardware do I need to have if I want to use Motoplay?

This topic will tell you all the Hardware you can buy to install on your motorcycle if you want to use Motoplay. Since there are many functions in Motoplay, not every function may be of interest of you, so the Hardware is divided into groups according to their functions. For each group, there is a Table below, informing you of the Hardware you need to have if you want to use the functions of the group.

Starting with the Computer group. Everything in this group is mandatory, and is necessary if you want to use Motoplay, as all the hardware in this group is directly connected to the central element of Motoplay, which is the on-board computer.

| <img src="This-Repository/rpi-4b.png" />     | Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (or better)    | The Raspberry Pi is the hardware we will use as a computer due to its flexibility and practicality. It is an excellent piece of hardware that comes with a great Linux/Debian distro, which is Raspbian OS, in addition to having HDMI, P2, Gigabit, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports, Bluetooth adapter and Wi-Fi. It is best if your Raspberry Pi is a 64-bit model, with at least 4GB of RAM and a 1.5 Ghz Quad-Core CPU. For this reason, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B or any other newer or higher model is recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Yes       |
| <img src="This-Repository/sd-card.png" />    | SD Card                               | The SD card works like an SSD for the Raspberry Pi. It is where you can save the system and all the files so that the Raspberry Pi can work. For best functionality and speed, a "SanDisk Ultra" or "SanDisk Extreme Pro" SD card of 32 GB or more is recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Yes       |
| <img src="This-Repository/sd-adapter.jpg" /> | SD Card Adapter                       | An SD Card to USB adapter will be crucial for you to be able to Read and Write data to your Raspberry Pi's SD Card using another computer. It is very useful for installing the operating system image onto the SD Card, and once everything is ready, just insert the SD Card into your Raspberry Pi. It is also very useful for using another computer to create Backup images of your SD Card. An adapter that supports USB 3.0 connection is recommended, as the USB 3.0 interface offers much higher Read and Write speeds than the USB 2.0 interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Yes       |
| <img src="This-Repository/screen.png" />     | Screen With Touchscreen Input Support | The screen is an essential component of the on-board computer that we intend to assemble for use with Motoplay, so it is crucial that the screen has Touch support as this will be the best way to interact with Motoplay. The screen must have a minimum resolution of 480x320 pixels, however, the recommended resolution is 800x480. It is desirable that the screen has at least 50hz and is IPS for a more beautiful image, however, it is not mandatory. Regarding the interface for connecting the screen to the Raspberry Pi. There are several models of portable screens on the market, and each model uses a different connection method. The most common is usually using the Raspberry Pi's HDMI ports, but for this project, the best interfaces are DSI or GPIO. Screens that are connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO interface usually work well, but they usually have lower refresh rates and only turn on when the operating system has already started. Screens connected using the DSI interface are the most recommended for this project, as they usually have higher refresh rates and quality, in addition to behaving very similarly to HDMI screens, turning on from the moment the Raspberry Pi is powered on, so it is possible to follow the entire boot process, up to the operating system startup. | Yes       |
| <img src="This-Repository/case.png" />       | Case                                  | The Case is a component that must be made for the version of Raspberry Pi that you have, and the Screen. There are several models of Cases on the market, in different materials, sizes and designs. It is not at all difficult to find Case + Screen Kits for a specific version of Raspberry Pi on websites such as AliExpress, for example. The Case in the image to the side, for example, was made for the "Raspberry Pi 4 Model B" that uses a 3.5' Screen that connects to the GPIO interface, like the Screen models "MHS3528" and "MPI3501".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Yes       |
| <img src="This-Repository/support.png" />    | Phone Holder                          | The Phone Holder will hold the Raspberry Pi with its Case. Generally, if the Phone Holder supports phones with a screen size of up to 7", it should be able to hold most Raspberry Pi Cases, but of course, it is always good to already have the Phone Holder on hand, to be more certain of which Case to buy. The recommended model of Phone Holder is the "claw", which is the model in the example image to the side. This model is known for holding more strongly and being easy to install. If you think the Holder will receive high vibration from the motorcycle, you can check the feasibility of installing it on the center of handlebar of your motorcycle, because the vibration may be less in the center of the handlebars, on some motorcycle models. If possible, buy a Phone Holder that does NOT have a USB Output, unless that USB Output meets the same requirements as the next hardware!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Yes       |
| <img src="This-Repository/usb-output.png" /> | Handlebar USB Output                  | This device works as a "socket" and must offer a USB output of at least 5 volts and 3.1 amps. Each version of the Raspberry Pi requires a specific amount of voltage and current to function. The Raspberry Pi 4, for example, requires 5 volts and 3 amps to function at its full performance. In addition, the advantage of this device is that it can be connected directly to the battery of your motorcycle, and it has a switch so that you can turn it off completely while you are not riding, to avoid problems with battery discharge. In this project, this device will be used as a socket for the Raspberry Pi. It is recommended that you purchase a version that has a fuse on the "positive" wire to avoid the risk of short circuits, and for greater safety of your vehicle. This device can also be easily found on sites like AliExpress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Yes       |
