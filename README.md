# What is Motoplay?

Motoplay is a project that aims to bring an on-board computer to motorcycles. The main point is that this computer must be 100% functional, running Linux, for greater flexibility, and be able to interact with the vehicle's ECU to read information of motor and vehicle, have a media player and several other functions. Basically, this computer should work as a kind of "second panel", with Touchscreen input support, on the motorcycle's handlebars, so that the rider can count on several functions within reach of just a few touches.

The project is divided into two layers, the Hardware layer and the Software layer. The Hardware layer consists of all the accessories (peripherals) that will be installed on the motorcycle and that will be used by the on-board computer, such as speakers, 5v3a USB output, camera, etc.

In the second layer, in Software, we will have the Linux operating system, which will run the "Motoplay" software in full time, which is a program that will function as the on-board computer's central hub, being the key point for the pilot's use of the computer.

Of course, there are some mandatory Hardware accessories that need to be installed on your motorcycle if you intend to use Motoplay. All of these components are listed below. After that, there are some necessary procedures to prepare the computer and install the "Motoplay" program on the computer. All of this and many other details are all documented on this page, if you want to continue learning more, just keep reading!
