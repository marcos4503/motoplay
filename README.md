# What is Motoplay?

Motoplay is a project that aims to bring an on-board computer to motorcycles. The main point is that this computer must be 100% functional, running Linux, for greater flexibility, and be able to interact with the vehicle's ECU to read information of motor and vehicle, have a media player and several other functions. Basically, this computer should work as a kind of "second panel", with Touchscreen input support, on the motorcycle's handlebars, so that the rider can count on several functions within reach of just a few touches.

The project is divided into two layers, the Hardware layer and the Software layer. The Hardware layer consists of all the accessories (peripherals) that will be installed on the motorcycle and that will be used by the on-board computer, such as speakers, 5v3a USB output, camera, etc.

In the second layer, in Software, we will have the Linux operating system, which will run the "Motoplay" software in full time, which is a program that will function as the on-board computer's central hub, being the key point for the pilot's use of the computer.

Of course, there are some mandatory Hardware accessories that need to be installed on your motorcycle if you intend to use Motoplay. All of these components are listed below. After that, there are some necessary procedures to prepare the computer and install the "Motoplay" program on the computer. All of this and many other details are all documented on this page, if you want to continue learning more, just keep reading!

# What Hardware do I need to have if I want to use Motoplay?

This topic will tell you all the Hardware you can buy to install on your motorcycle if you want to use Motoplay. Since there are many functions in Motoplay, not every function may be of interest of you, so the Hardware is divided into groups according to their functions. For each group, there is a Table below, informing you of the Hardware you need to have if you want to use the functions of the group.

Starting with the Computer group. Everything in this group is mandatory, and is necessary if you want to use Motoplay, as all the hardware in this group is directly connected to the central element of Motoplay, which is the on-board computer.

| <img src="This-Repository/rpi-4b.png" />  | Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (or better) | The Raspberry Pi is the hardware we will use as a computer due to its flexibility and practicality. It is an excellent piece of hardware that comes with a great Linux/Debian distro, which is Raspbian OS, in addition to having HDMI, P2, Gigabit, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports, Bluetooth adapter and Wi-Fi. It is best if your Raspberry Pi is a 64-bit model, with at least 4GB of RAM and a 1.5 Ghz Quad-Core CPU. For this reason, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B or any other newer or higher model is recommended. | Yes       |
| <img src="This-Repository/sd-card.png" /> | SD Card                            | The SD card works like an SSD for the Raspberry Pi. It is where you can save the system and all the files so that the Raspberry Pi can work. For best functionality and speed, a "SanDisk Ultra" or "SanDisk Extreme Pro" SD card of 32 GB or more is recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Yes       |
